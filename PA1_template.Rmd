## Loading and preprocessing the data
Sorry if my english is not good. 
Unzip the file in your working directory and load with R:
```{r}
library("lubridate")
data<-read.csv("activity.csv")
data$date<-ymd(data$date)

#steps per day

steps_day<-aggregate(steps~date,data,sum,na.rm=TRUE)

```




## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

making a histogram for steps per day

```{r}
summary(steps_day$steps)
hist(steps_day$steps, col='green', breaks=10)
mean_step<-mean(steps_day$steps)
median_step<-median(steps_day$steps)
abline(v=mean_step, col='red', lwd=4) #mean of steps per day
```

* The mean of steps per day is `r format(mean_step, digits=2)`
* The median of the steps per day is: `r format(median_step, digits=2)`


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
